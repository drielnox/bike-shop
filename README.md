## Design
I tried to decompose in the smallest possible number of possible domain entities and delegate, correctly, the functionality to each entity.

## Development Practices
I applied TDD in the form of "test first, code later". In the last commits, I preferred to spend more time in refactoring and designing by eye. In addition, I had the following principles in mind: SOLID, DRY, YAGNI and KISS.

## How run the test
Open Visual Studio 2017 (any version) and execute the test via Test Explorer.
